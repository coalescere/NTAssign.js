# Chirality Assignment Program of SWCNT [![CodeFactor](https://www.codefactor.io/repository/github/visualer/ntassign-js/badge)](https://www.codefactor.io/repository/github/visualer/ntassign-js)

## Overview

This is the source code of the website described in _ACS Nano_, **2017**, _11_ (10), pp 10509â€“10518, as an encapsulation of the chirality determining function of the bilayer graph. However, the assignment logic is not described in the paper, which is implemented here, **and may be updated at any time**.

The official release of this project is hosted at:

> [cntassign.ga](http://cntassign.ga) => [www.chem.pku.edu.cn/cnt_assign](http://www.chem.pku.edu.cn/cnt_assign)

A (maybe fallback) version is available if our server is down:

> [cntassign.tk](http://cntassign.tk) => [cntassign.gearhostpreview.com](http://cntassign.gearhostpreview.com)

## Usage

View the paper and site above (with tutorial videos) for details.
