# Chirality Assignment Program of SWCNT [![CodeFactor](https://www.codefactor.io/repository/github/coalescere/ntassign.js/badge)](https://www.codefactor.io/repository/github/coalescere/ntassign.js)

Updated 2018/6/3

## Overview

This is the source code of the website described in _ACS Nano_, **2017**, _11_ (10), pp 10509â€“10518, as an encapsulation of the chirality determining function of the bilayer graph. However, the assignment logic is not described in the paper, which is implemented here, **and may be updated at any time**.

The official release of this project is hosted at:
